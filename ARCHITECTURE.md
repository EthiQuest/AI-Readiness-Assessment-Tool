# AI Ethics Assessment Model: Technical Architecture

## Model Choice: BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)

For our AI Ethics Assessment Tool, we have chosen to use BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) as our core language model. This decision was made after careful consideration of our project's requirements, ethical considerations, and technical constraints.

### Why BERT?

1. **On-Premise Deployment**: 
   BERT can be easily deployed on-premise, allowing us to maintain complete control over our data and model. This is crucial for ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of potentially sensitive information handled during AI ethics assessments.

2. **Data Security**: 
   By deploying BERT on-premise, we ensure that all data processing occurs within our controlled environment. This approach significantly reduces the risk of data breaches and complies with stringent data protection regulations.

3. **Customization**: 
   BERT can be fine-tuned on our specific AI ethics dataset. This allows us to create a model that is tailored to the nuances and complexities of AI ethics assessment, potentially improving its accuracy and relevance.

4. **Cost-Effectiveness**: 
   After the initial setup and training, running BERT doesn't incur per-query costs. This makes it a more scalable solution, especially as the usage of our tool grows.

5. **Task Suitability**: 
   For the specific task of classifying and assessing AI ethics scenarios, a fine-tuned BERT model provides a good balance of performance and resource requirements.

6. **Transparency and Control**: 
   Using BERT gives us full visibility into the model's workings. This transparency is crucial when the tool itself is meant to assess AI ethics, allowing us to ensure that our assessment model aligns with ethical AI principles.

7. **Regulatory Compliance**: 
   On-premise deployment of BERT makes it easier to comply with regulations that require data to be processed within certain geographical boundaries.

### Technical Implementation

Our implementation of BERT involves the following key components:

1. **Base Model**: We start with the pre-trained BERT model, specifically the 'bert-base-uncased' variant.

2. **Fine-Tuning**: We fine-tune this base model on our curated dataset of AI ethics scenarios and principles. This process adapts BERT's language understanding capabilities to our specific domain.

3. **Classification Layer**: On top of the fine-tuned BERT, we add a classification layer that outputs probabilities for different ethical principles or assessment categories.

4. **Tokenization**: We use BERT's tokenizer to process input text, ensuring that our text data is formatted correctly for the model.

5. **Deployment**: The model is deployed in a secure, on-premise environment, with appropriate access controls and encryption measures in place.

### Future Considerations

While BERT serves our current needs effectively, we remain open to exploring other models or hybrid approaches in the future. This could include:

- Experimenting with other transformer-based models like RoBERTa or ALBERT.
- Investigating the use of larger models like OpenAI's GPT-models or Anthropicâ€™s Claude-models for specific tasks where their advanced capabilities might be beneficial, while maintaining BERT as our core, on-premise solution.
- Continuously updating our model as new advancements in NLP and AI ethics emerge.

By choosing BERT, we have established a strong foundation for our AI Ethics Assessment Tool that prioritizes security, customization, and ethical considerations.
